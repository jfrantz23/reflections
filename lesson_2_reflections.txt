1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	so far I haven't noticed much because the repository hasn't had any changes to it yet. withouth the repository git has nothing to check.
2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	the staging area are files being prepped for the git repository so that they may be commited and used for later. as opposed to the working directory which are files
	currently in the directory but are not prepped to be commited. the staging area allows you to pick which files you want to save and lump together, rather than dealing
	with every single file in the directory.

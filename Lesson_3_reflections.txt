When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if you were on a different computer other than your usual one it would be a nice way to use the files from another location.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
there might be a file created by another user that you don't want or maybe some changes you were working on that you decided later you didn't actually want, and if it auto updated it would mess up your remote repository.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks allow you to take someone elses project and make changes in your own profile without changing the original, and also gives them credit. A clone is a direct copy of a project that you can upload back to change the original project if the creator allows it. A branch is when a line of a project splits off and is adjusted for things like feature testing or debugging, so that you dont accidentally make changes to or ruin an entire project on accident.
